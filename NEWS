Changes in mirtCAT 0.2

  - temporary files can now be saved while the GUI is running, and restored
  at a later time

  - more estimation options can be passed to `fscores()` via the ... argument

  - sensitive objects are now removed from the package namespace when the
  `mirtCAT()` finishes unsuccessfully

  - categories are always returned with based 1 for first response in the GUI

  - add content balancing option

  - various bug fixes, and update documentation

  - new `findNextItem()` input for users to locate the next item to administer
  (likely for custom CAT interfaces that do not use the Shiny package). Can
  be updated with the `updateDesign()` function

  - moved 'Next' button in the web interface to the left panel box so that
  it will always remain in the same location

  - support CSS customization

  - switch multidimensional selection criteria to use analytical expressions
  rather than numerical.  Several multivariate Fisher information matrix
  computation currently not supported analytically, but will be steadily added.

  - add classification capabilities to `design` list input
