Changes in mirtCAT 0.3

  - `item_answers` can now be a list input, indicating that more than one
  correct answer is possible for a given item

  - allow the first page and demographics page to be skipped by passing
  empty list arguments

  - added 'fixed' method to keep latent trait estimates at fixed values
  (useful for preCAT)

  - Fisher information matrix added for remaining multidimensional models
  supported by `mirt`, including custom item types

  - add 'Arule' and 'APrule' for minimum trace criteria of asymtotic
  covariance matrix

Changes in mirtCAT 0.2

  - temporary files can now be saved while the GUI is running, and restored
  at a later time

  - more estimation options can be passed to `fscores()` via the ... argument

  - sensitive objects are now removed from the package namespace when the
  `mirtCAT()` finishes unsuccessfully

  - categories are always returned with based 1 for first response in the GUI

  - add content balancing option

  - various bug fixes, and update documentation

  - new `findNextItem()` input for users to locate the next item to administer
  (likely for custom CAT interfaces that do not use the Shiny package). Can
  be updated with the `updateDesign()` function

  - moved 'Next' button in the web interface to the left panel box so that
  it will always remain in the same location

  - support CSS customization

  - switch multidimensional selection criteria to use analytical expressions
  rather than numerical.  Several multivariate Fisher information matrix
  computation currently not supported analytically, but will be steadily added.

  - add classification capabilities to `design` list input
