Changes in mirtCAT 0.4

  - `forced_choice` argument for shinyGUI input to state whether respones
  for each item are required (for CATs, this should always be TRUE)

  - respones in GUI now are blank by default

  - in `preCAT` list input change `nitems` to `min_items` and `max_items` for
  better control. Also include a `response_variance` logical to terminate
  the preCAT stage when variability in the the response options occurs
  (so that ML estimation becomes plausible)

  - include Sympson-Hetter method of item exposure control

  - major re-write of shiny inputs. Now the questions, answers, and options
  are all supplied through a `data.frame` object for better clarity, and all
  shiny inputs regarding the questions, image locations, etc, are specified
  in this object

  - `mirt_object` input renamed to `mo` for short

  - the `local_pattern` input now accepts a matrix of response patterns for
  running simulation designs. Returns a list of person objects instead of
  a single object

  - `generate_pattern()` now supports multiple Theta inputs specifically
  for simulation designs

  - `start_item` input now accepts character value inputs (in addition to
  explicit numeric inputs) corresponding to the `criteria` argument. This
  allows the first item to be selected using the (adaptive) selection criteria

  - added `generate.mirt_object()` function to build the required `mirt_object`
  input given population parameters

  - new `cl` argument in `mirtCAT()` for passing a parallel cluster object
  defined from the parallel package. Used to run simulation designs with
  parallel architecture for better speed

  - by default, the demographics page is no longer generated in the GUI

Changes in mirtCAT 0.3

  - `item_answers` can now be a list input, indicating that more than one
  correct answer is possible for a given item

  - allow the first page and demographics page to be skipped by passing
  empty list arguments

  - added 'fixed' method to keep latent trait estimates at fixed values
  (useful for preCAT)

  - Fisher information matrix added for remaining multidimensional models
  supported by `mirt`, including custom item types

  - add 'Arule' and 'APrule' for minimum trace criteria of asymtotic
  covariance matrix

Changes in mirtCAT 0.2

  - temporary files can now be saved while the GUI is running, and restored
  at a later time

  - more estimation options can be passed to `fscores()` via the ... argument

  - sensitive objects are now removed from the package namespace when the
  `mirtCAT()` finishes unsuccessfully

  - categories are always returned with based 1 for first response in the GUI

  - add content balancing option

  - various bug fixes, and update documentation

  - new `findNextItem()` input for users to locate the next item to administer
  (likely for custom CAT interfaces that do not use the Shiny package). Can
  be updated with the `updateDesign()` function

  - moved 'Next' button in the web interface to the left panel box so that
  it will always remain in the same location

  - support CSS customization

  - switch multidimensional selection criteria to use analytical expressions
  rather than numerical.  Several multivariate Fisher information matrix
  computation currently not supported analytically, but will be steadily added.

  - add classification capabilities to `design` list input
